    "<h3>Part 3: Examining price breakdown based on region and restaurant category</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The RQ:</b> How does price rating (\\$, \\$\\$, \\$\\$\\$, \\$\\$\\$\\$) breakdown for our randomly pulled cities? What is a the price rating breakdown by specific region and restaurant category? We expect higher income regions to have higher priced restaurants - ex: we would expect New York County  to have more 4\\$ restaurants than a given county in the Midwest. We will see if the data of our randomly selected cities shows an even or uneven distribution based on price breakdown by category and by region. \n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "After examining the categorical breakdown based on county, we moved on to determine the price breakdown by both region and restaurant category. \n",
    "\n",
    "This was Randi's portion of the project. We ran into some tricky stuff with the stacked bar charts. The primary issue was that the each bar's list needed to be the same length, that was fine, except when there was a restaurant for every price braket. Also, in all of her research Randi could not find how to make the stacked bars dynamic. In all the examples she found, the bar values were created manually. This is fine if you have a small dataset that you do not intend to run over and over again; however, this was not ideal for this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>With some help from Mirko, Ryan, and Caleb, we figured it out! </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we needed to define this list we would be looping through. For the first chart, Number of \\$ per Category, we created a list named labels that contained all the different restaurant categories. Then, we created a second list with four empty lists. These four empty lists would represet 1\\$, 2\\$, 3\\$, and 4\\$. We then looped through our category list and found the count for each of the dollar ratings in said category. Once the loop determined how many 1\\$, 2\\$, 3\\$, and 4\\$ there were in each category it appended it to the corresponding empty list. If we did not find a 1\\$, 2\\$, 3\\$, and 4\\$ for a particular restaurant category, then the except argument kicked-in and instead appended a zero. Again, the goal was to make each of the four lists the same length. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, we ended up with a list corresponding to 1\\$, 2\\$, 3\\$, and 4\\$, with ratings per restaurant category. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we created this loop and stored the counts in lists, we could call these lists in our chart creation; thereby, making the charts dynamic, changing with the number of pulls."
